ADR-0001: Linearizations



Date 

Status: Completed



Context:

To develop linear Controller and linear plant linearizations were required.



Decision:

While finding equilibirium points through nonlinear controller and nonlinear plant. Different Response of input and states  was observed in Takeoff, Cruise and Landing because of which three linearizations for each section was planned. More than one equilibirium points were observed in Takeoff and Landing because of that average of all equilibirium points were considereded in that case.

Consequences:

Three different A, B, E \& P0 Matrices were obtained for each case.

Matrices A, B, E \& P0 are derived as per Christopher T, Aksland, Andrew G, Alleyne

Matrix sizes 

A = 12\*12

B = 12\*4

E = 12\*2

P0 = 12\*1



Implementation notes:

SOC was not considered during linearizations, was embedded in plant after wards.



Graph based model Matrix sizes (C\*x = -M\*P + D\*Pin) for linearizations

C = Capacitance Matrix size 12\*12

X = Only states 1 to 13 were considered ommiting SOC which is third state, Matrix size 12\*1

M = Incidence Matrix size was 12\*20; - sign was included during equation calculation

P = Power flow 3 was ommited because of SOC ommision, Matrix size 20\*1 

D = Matrix size 12\*1, Because Pin is 1\*1

Pin = m\_dot\_ramU4\*cp\_air\*T\_ram, Matrix size 1\*1
