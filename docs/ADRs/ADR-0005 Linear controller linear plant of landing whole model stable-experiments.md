ADR-0005 Linear controller linear plant of landing whole model stable-experiments



Date

Status: Completed



Context:



To check which linearization and initial conditions make complete model stable



Decision:

All plants were separately run



Consequences:

Optimization with landing linearized plant and initial conditions was fullz stable
very fast optimization 


Implementation notes:

A, B, E, P0 of Landing linearization as used
