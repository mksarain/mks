Equilibrium points were taken from nonlinear model (reference aircraft control john Lewis’s book), and three linearization’s was carried out.

Parameters and Pprop was divided into sections as per three linearization’s to run separately. All three sections standalone were stabilized for optimization.

First attempt was to combine all three models for their runtime to give a combined output by putting mpc in enabled subsystem for their specific runtime.

Attempt was made on only takeoff to test this enabled subsystem worked but outputs were repeating their last values as per their runtime for complete simulation time which was main issue as combined output of these three would not be current in this way.

Options for different mpcs block were checked but because of application mismatch did not use any other.

Mode approach was used to provide three plants to linearized mpc and linearized plant as a state function which switch based on runtime.

Optimization was stable for takeoff and landing part only. Tested same linearized mpc on nonlinear plant same results.

Initial conditions switching as per plants were attempted which resulted in optimization being fully unstable for linear mpc linear plant, but partially stable in takeoff and landing for linear mpc nonlinear plant.
